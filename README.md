# CS_hackaton
CS group project

Brief
The CEO of CS-Streaming has brought you and your team in to analyse Netflix data for their new
streaming service. They are confident that your analysis will be helpful to you in making decisions about
their service. They need your expertise to uncover trends and insights from the Netflix data that will be
beneficial to their new product. They are eager to begin this project and will therefore need a timely
response.
You are to report on how CS-Streaming can best optimise its services and compete with Netflix

This data set has many issues that limits the amount of information that can be gathered.
Time limit for this project was 2 days.
There is a corresponding presentation too.
